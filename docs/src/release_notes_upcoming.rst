release-notes:: Upcoming

    - SV App

        - The deprecated (in 0.8.0) public ``/v0/dso`` endpoint has been removed.
          Use the public ``/v0/dso`` endpoint in the scan app if you need to fetch DSO info without SV operator credentials.

        - Joining SVs now fetch DSO info during onboarding from a scan instance
          (typically the sponsor's) instead of the sponsor SV app's deprecated public
          ``/v0/dso`` endpoint. The scan is configured via the new ``.joinWithKeyOnboarding.sponsorScanUrl`` Helm value.
          SVs who set the ``.joinWithKeyOnboarding`` key config must set it before upgrading.

    - Docker Compose

        - The validator deployment can now also deploy the Canton Wallet Gateway and the Portfolio UI with the new ``-g`` flag of ``start.sh``.

    - Helm

        - The deprecated `splice-domain` Helm chart has been removed.

    - Scan App

        - Added a new public ``/v0/events/latest-record-time`` endpoint that returns the latest
          record time for which ``/v0/events`` will be able to return events.

        - Added an automation to prune the DB tables having the temporary data used
          by the verdict ingestion service and the traffic-based app reward calculations.

          The default retention period is 1 week for this automation, after which the data will be removed from the DB.

    - Validator App

        - The minting-delegation reward collection for external parties now also collects
          ``SvRewardCoupon`` rewards. An external party that is a beneficiary of SV rewards
          will have those coupons minted on its behalf by its delegate, alongside the other
          reward-coupon types.
